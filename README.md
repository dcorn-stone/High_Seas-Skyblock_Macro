**Instructions**

Time before the macro starts(seconds):
  The time before this program to start(set a time for yourself to get ready, otherwise it will be a mess).
  <If the program doesn't respond after you have pressed the start button, it's normal, because thie value is time that the program needs to sleep for>

  
press 'w':
  If your farm needs you to farm with 'w' and other keys pressed at the same time, tick this, otherwise just leave it blank.

  
Initial button/Button after lane changed:
  For example, if you need to farm to the right and farm back to the left after you changed your lane, set the initial button to 'd' and set the button
  after lane changed to 'a'. -- If you only need to go forwards and backwards, set press 'w' to false and input 'w' and 's' as your initial button and
  button after lane changed.


Time between lane changes(seconds):
  set this number to the time that you take to get to the other end of the lane, this value is the time for the program to change frmo your initial button     to the button after lane changed.


Cycle times:
  One cycle = With 'initial button pressed' + farm to the other end of the lane; change lane; with 'button after lane changed' pressed + farm back to the
  side where you started farming
  This value depends how many lanes you have, e.g.  8 lanes = cycle 4 times.
